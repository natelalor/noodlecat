# So... what's "noodle cat"?
## Summary
The phrase, "noodlecat," has always been an inside joke with my home friends. Thus, I got the domain as kind of an inside joke. However, I am excited to have a space where I can focus on expanding my creativity in website design, to further test my web development skills and create an engaging environment for the user.
