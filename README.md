### So... what is a "noodle cat"?
The website [noodlecat.org](https://www.noodlecat.org/) offers the users an engaging puzzle story. Through many pages backed with simple HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, the goal was to provide a story through confusing tasks given to the user. I wanted to foster an environment that would support critical thinking and thinking outside the box.

### Development
At the time of development, most of my projects were for school assignments. Algorithm analysis, C++ software development, and other such technical topics. I wanted a creative outlet. That is when noodlecat was created, but not when noodlecat was born. That comes a few months later - when the idea for a user-centic website story. 

After months of brainstorming, I realized I wanted to build a website that was different. I wanted to build a website that was built around interaction with the user. More than that, I wanted it to make people think. With inspiration coming from alantutorial, D.H.M.I.S., and salad fingers, I wanted to create an environment that would engage the users with activities, but also engage them with the mindboggling storyline. To have a website full of puzzles is one thing, but to fully implement it around an appealing narrative is another.

Oh, and as for the term, "noodle cat"...
The phrase, "noodlecat," has always been an inside joke with my friends growing up. When I wanted another domain to help provide me space to be creative and explore my interests, noodlecat was what came to mind.
